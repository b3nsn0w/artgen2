# === UNDER CONSTRUCTION ===

_Artgen 2: Inception_ is a continuation of the [modern art generator](https://b3nsn0w.github.io/artgen/main.html) I've made long ago. (Very long ago, please don't judge my code.)

## Current TODO list:

- [x] deterministic random generator
- [x] palette generator
- [x] shape generator
  - [ ] more shapes
- [x] shape rendering
- [x] art fractal
  - [x] basic fractal layers
  - [x] autolayering
  - [x] fractal zoom
- [x] optimization
- [ ] a million other things, for example
  - [ ] actual ui
  - [ ] mouse-zoom instead of center-zoom
  - [ ] deep linking
  - [ ] export
- [x] webpack setup

Everything is subject to change. _Everything._ Even this sentence.

If you feel like you could contribute, feel free to join. Submit an issue on GitHub, treat it like Reddit, whatever you want. This is an art project, creativity is very much encouraged, especially in unexpected places.
